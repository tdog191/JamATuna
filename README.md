A multiplayer music jamming application. Yay!  
https://jamatuna.herokuapp.com/

Simply jump on the website and join a jam room. After the jam room loads, click on the colored tiles to create music. Also try clicking and holding to continuously create music! Try inviting a friend too. If they are in the same jam room as you, you can both jam together. Other players show up as white flashes on the corresponding tile they clicked, and you'll hear what they play!
